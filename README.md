# SeedClassifier

This repository includes an open approach utilising image
segmentation and supervised “classic” learning models to classify each seed
in a mixed package based on its morphological characteristics. This work is
part of a broader project within our lab aimed at evaluating the quality of the
native flower seed market and assessing the viability of these seeds for creating
new habitats. Our achieved F1 score and accuracy exceed 95%, and the
models can also ignore seeds from species they have not encountered during
training (open-set classification), achieving over 90 % performance. Thus, the
approach is fully functional, with models and code available here for any
lab wishing to use or adapt it for different applications.
